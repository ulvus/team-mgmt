## Agenda

- Ensure a notetaker exists!
  - The notetaker should:
    - Add bullet points of what is said to each section of this file
    - Wait a day or two for people to add their async updates
    - PR this file into https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt
- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Initiatives
- Blockers (from the async status update)
- General questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases

- [go-ipfs 0.6 launched](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
  - release with preparation for upcoming new features/improvements, like QUIC, base36

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

- This effort is closing as of the 0.6 launch. The team is reviewing priorities for Q3 and will create new initiatives as a result of that this week.

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel @riba

- wip to rebase [go-ipfs#7441](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/7441) and change it to try Base36 or return error (simplify everything, no automagical root node replacement, no rehashing)
  - should be ready for review later this week
  - reducing scope for now with a simpler implementation

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- no update

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs / üó°Ô∏è )
@ribasushi
 - minimal amount of work done, no push-able update on üó°Ô∏è for the past week

#### Rust IPFS Initiative
@aphelionz

- Phase 2 is completed! You can read the grant report here: https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/open-grants/ipfs-rust/phase-2/reports/phase-2.md
- `ipfs add` coming soon
- Working on a blog post for blog.ipfs.io
- Preparing for Phase 3: https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/issues/181

#### js-libp2p-rendezvous
@vasco-santos

- no update
  - still blocked on current signed peer records implementation in js-libp2p
  
#### Signed Peer Records

- Work in progress
  - Record Interface
      - [libp2p/js-libp2p-interfaces#52](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-interfaces/pull/52)
  - Record Manager
    - [libp2p/js-libp2p#681](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/681)

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- no update

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@achingbrain

- In progress - integrating migration/repo work with js-ipfs

#### Pinning system revamp
@achingbrain

- Finishing js-ipfs repo migration tool to unblock this

#### Shared IPFS node
@gozala

- Pull request is ready for the review
- Still waiting on reviews to propagate changes in depenencies
- Have issues with testing on Electron

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design reviews

- Pinning Services integration
    - we need to define the scope of go-ipfs changes related to this epic
    - [technical analysis of ipfs-webui needs is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0R7woLtW_YTv9P9IOrUNK6QafgctJ7qTggEUdepD_c/edit#) 
    ‚Äì familiarize with the above, let's meet this week to discuss the scope
    - add your name if you want to be part of the call
      - lidel (wb/gui)
      - Adin (go-ipfs)
      - Alex (would be good to include js-ipfs)
      - ...
    - Goal: clarify the scope

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- Waiting no some protons change to be either accepted or instructions what needs to be done (see https://github.com/ipfs/protons/pull/13)
- Intermittent test failures in JS-IPFS repo makes it really hard to tell if failures are regresseions or known issues. Can we figure out better strategy to keep those without making tree red.

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

- Alex out on Friday

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant 
to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
