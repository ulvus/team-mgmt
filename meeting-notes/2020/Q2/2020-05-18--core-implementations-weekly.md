  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

## Notes

  - cancellable requests
  - datastore-idb
  - removal of node globals & built-ins
  - blogpost on the way

- go-ipfs 0.5.1 (+[ipfs-desktop v0.11.3](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/tag/v0.11.3))
  - IPNS timeout bug fix
  - QUIC leaks
  - CPU issue when canceling DHT queries.
  

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

* üê≤ Hydra update
    * Suspected SQL datastore memory leak wasn't a memory leak ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. PostgreSQL server was running at 100% CPU and queries were executing very slowly.
        * Fixed by adding a `text_pattern_ops` index on the `key` field of the table the datastore uses
    * QUIC had a memory leak (was fixed) & QUIC still has a memory leak
        * QUIC is now disabled temporarily
          * @stebalien -- tracking bug?
    * Hydras are sharing ~**20 million** provider records right now in the shared Postgres datastore üò≤
        * <media-tag src="https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/21/21ae682c6816ba0ae8714e5b40f5a8a111da1c348161c7a4" data-crypto-key="cryptpad:X6vl26/qgjJakIor3NFDithL2fLTx8V7guVBQkYQ6ug="></media-tag>
    * Currently scaled to 5 Hydras each with 100 heads
    * Switched to using leveldb [`pstoreds`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-peerstore/tree/master/pstoreds) (from `pstoremem`) **with GC turned off**!
        * Hydras are using around **5-10GB less RAM** overall and it won't eventually cause OOM
        * There is a memory explosion problem with GC in `pstoreds` [libp2p/go-libp2p-peerstore#151](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-peerstore/issues/151)
    * Next:
        * Add 5 more Hydras & decommission the dht-boosters
        * Complete remaining tasks doc and post mortem doc

* DHT
  * Preparing for go-ipfs 0.6.0
  * Reduced allocations & improved performance.
* NAT research retreat
  * Results:
    * Dialback protocol: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/925
    * Prioritize WebRTC
    * Shared understanding of NATs
    * Consider using TURN (and friends) as "out of the box" protocols.

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- dweb.link: ipns paths work now! 
  demo:  https://dweb.link/ipns/QmPRB9SNEfYaTaZ88VLCpddTYD45B53sC8yH8xYZXGPLJp 
- wip: **figuring out [Subdomain support for CIDs longer than 63](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7318)**

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
Currently working on
- [Some performance improvements](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/392)
- [Tighter synchronization of sessions with blockstore](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/391)

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs / üó°Ô∏è )
@ribasushi

- After [another 5kloc changes](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/DAGger/compare/1e43bc650cf...95e236a5fdd) everything finally converges with everything
- Working in parallel on:
  - Extensive documentation for other teams (internal and external)
  - .deb repo import benchmarks based on https://github.com/ipfs-inactive/package-managers/issues/18#issue-418828188, to determine the scope of "what to migrate into go-ipfs at stage 1"

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

No updates

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@hsanjuan

- A meeting was had
  - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/242#issuecomment-627533056
  - Resolution: store blocks by multihash.
    - Additionally, look into storing additional metadata.

#### Pinning system revamp
@achingbrain

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- Meet to agree how to handle [Subdomain support for CIDs longer than 63](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7318) 
  Add yourself if you want to be on the call:
  - @Stebalien
  - @lidel
  - @ribasushi
  - @aschmahmann
  - ...

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- (@gozala) Sharing nodes across browser tabs implies sharing / agreeing configuration. That is also challenge facing (or maybe will face) native IPFS support in browsers. Also a thing came up in the past with Textile Desktop / Radicle / IPFS Desktop. **Can we bake right configration for in- browser nodes?**
  - Did some preliminary analyses / notes here & can use feedback https://gozala.io/pl-notes/Analysis%20of%20shared%20IPFS%20config
  - It seems some configurations could be moved into API call options
  - Some configuration it seems should be a users decision and not an embedders.


### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant 
to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
