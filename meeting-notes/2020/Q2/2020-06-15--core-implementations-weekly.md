## Agenda

- Ensure a notetaker exists!
  - The notetaker should:
    - Add bullet points of what is said to each section of this file
    - Wait a day or two for people to add their async updates
    - PR this file into https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt
- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Initiatives
- Blockers (from the async status update)
- General questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases

- go-ipfs 0.6 RC 6 [go-ipfs#7347](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7347)
  - 0.6 should ship this week

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

- go-ipfs 0.6 release
- misc DHT improvements/fixes for go-ipfs 0.7

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel @riba

- Base36
  - JS: [`cids@0.8.2`](https://github.com/multiformats/js-cid/releases/tag/v0.8.2) library shipped with support for Base36, which solves the problem of representing ED25519 keys on subdomain gateways. 
  - GO: go-ipfs 0.6.0 supports conversion to DNS-safe CIDv1 in Base36: `ipfs cid format -v 1 --codec libp2p-key -b base36 z5AanNVJCxnNXk3KysfhKVHaJecKEY2RxgsrNaGb89fuzXVqjaEndN1` ‚Üí `k51qzi5uqu5dj16qyiq0tajolkojyl9qdkr254920wxv7ghtuwcz593tp69z9m`
  - updated https://cid.ipfs.io to support ED25519 represented as CIDv1 in Base36
- in review: PRs arelated to subdomain gateway  (X-Forwarded-host, redirect to different hostname, wildcards from infura, etc)
- no progress on https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/7441 yet
  - but pretty sure we want error page + opt-in by the user
  - idea: we may disable JS and load from path instead

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- [Fix PeerManager signalAvailabiity() race](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/417)
- [Refactor Bitswap message receiving](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/398)

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs / üó°Ô∏è )
@ribasushi
  - Virtually no update this week: selectors/lotus work
  - Still looking to finish this sometime this week, do not take off board yet
 

#### Rust IPFS Initiative
@aphelionz

- Phase 2 wrapping up this week with /get support (including tar)
- Phase 3 still open question: https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/issues/181

#### js-libp2p-rendezvous
@vasco-santos

- Initial implementation
  - [libp2p/js-libp2p-rendezvous#6](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-rendezvous/pull/6)
- Working on libp2p signed peer records
  - dependency for secure rendezvous record exchange

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- no update

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@achingbrain

- Finishing js-ipfs repo migration tool to unblock this

#### Pinning system revamp
@achingbrain

- Finishing js-ipfs repo migration tool to unblock this

#### Shared IPFS node
@gozala

- All the `ipfs.dag` test are passing now on my device
  - Except few that I have disabled (Tests that take CID as string or CID + path combo).
  - On CI it's hard to tell due to intermitient failures
- Need [concensus on switch to new IPLD stack + simpler API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3022#issuecomment-641542193)
- Changes across libraries that this depends on
  - [ ] `Uint8Array` support in dag-pb [ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb#184](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb/pull/184)
    - [ ] `Uint8Array` support in protons [ipfs/protons#13]( https://github.com/ipfs/protons/pull/13)
      - [x] Exposing `TextEncoder` from ipfs-utils [ipfs/js-ipfs-utils#44](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-utils/pull/44)
  - [x] `Uint8Array` support in dag-cbor [ipld/js-ipld-dag-cbor#129](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-cbor/pull/129)
  - [ ] `Uint8Array` support in ipld-block [ipld/js-ipld-block#53](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-block/pull/53)


### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design reviews

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- Almost blocked: Need [concensus on switch to new IPLD stack + simpler API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3022#issuecomment-641542193)

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

- @stebalien is stepping down as the go-ipfs maintainer, @aschmahmann is stepping up as the new maintainer.
  - I'll be working on the Filecoin actors, one step closer to IPLD!
